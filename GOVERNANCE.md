# Governance

This repository publishes a **static adoption toolkit** for TFWS v2.

## Scope
- Documentation, templates, and scripts that help anyone adopt TFWS signals on their own domain.
- No runtime services.
- No central registry.
- No certification or authoritative claims.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome via Pull Requests (PRs). Maintainers may refuse changes that:
- Introduce centralized authority assumptions
- Add runtime services / databases / login flows
- Turn the kit into a certification mechanism
- Add tracking or telemetry

## Compatibility
The toolkit aims to remain:
- minimal
- stable
- easy to mirror
- usable offline (where practical)

## Decision rule
If a change increases centralization or adoption friction, it is likely rejected.
