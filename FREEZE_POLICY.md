# TFWS Adoption Kit — Freeze Policy

## Scope
This policy applies to **TFWS Adoption Kit v0.1.0** and all published releases.

## What is frozen
- Published releases (tags) are immutable
- Templates included in a release will not be modified retroactively
- Release artifacts remain available indefinitely

## What may change
- New releases may add guides, scripts, or templates
- Backward compatibility will be preserved whenever possible

## Versioning rules
- Patch changes: v0.1.x (typos, clarifications)
- Minor changes: v0.x.0 (new guides, optional features)
- Breaking changes require a new major version

## Principle
Trust depends on stability.
Once published, a release becomes a permanent reference point.

## Authority
This project does not certify adopters and does not act as a central authority.
